## Setup and Installation

[**Please provide instructions on how to build and run the project. This might include:**]

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Ensure you have the Android SDK for API level 34 installed.
4.  The project uses API keys for Cloudinary which are currently embedded in `app/build.gradle`. For security, these should ideally be moved to `local.properties` or a secure backend and not committed to version control.
    *   If moving to `local.properties`, create a `local.properties` file in the root of the project (if it doesn't exist) and add the following lines:
        ```properties
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET"
        ```
        Then, update `app/build.gradle` to read these values.
5.  Build and run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.
